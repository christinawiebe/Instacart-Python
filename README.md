## Objective
![instacart](https://github.com/christinawiebe/Instacart-Python/assets/148780253/49e5e565-4c64-4cb7-b705-97c6c8a166e8)

Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. Although their sales are already very good, the company wants to uncover more information about their sales patterns. The purpose of this project is to derive insights and make suggestions on how to improve their marketing strategies.

## Key Questions

- What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?
- Are there particular times of the day when people spend the most money?
- Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others?
- What's the distribution among users in regards to brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer's region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?

## Data
Instacart is a real company thatâ€™s made their data available online. The "customer" data set as well as the "prices" column in the "products" data set, however, have been fabricated by CareerFoundry for the purpose of this project. Data has not been uploaded due to size.

- customers
- departments
- orders
- orders_products_prior
- products

## Tools
The data was analysed using Python with the following libraries:

- pandas: for data analysis
- NumPy: for mathematical equations
- Matplotlib: for data visualization
- seaborn: for data visualization
- SciPy: for mathematical equations
